# assets note

The preview uses blexmono with an oversaturated, color-corrected macOS sequoia wallpaper as the background (`wallpaper-scaled-up.png`).

Aesthetic gaps, rich colors, and lots of panels makes for pretty previews,
however I never work like this lol; I highly recommend you don't either.

I find the default macOS wallpapers that come with each major version by far the best backgrounds.
They're beautiful and satisfying to look at, yet never feel distracting.
I dislike artwork and saturated wallpapers because they snatch my focus,
and make me want to use a transparent terminal- and I hate transparent
terminals (not the people who use them though!)

The best background should be that: a background.
